## Getting Started

import the java file to your java-supported work environment 
for exemple- "eclipse-workspace"


### Prerequisites

make sure the workspace support the libraries: 

java.awt,

java.uti,

javax.swing,



## Running 

Easy to use, press the right buttons for the desired range of values.

* for part a the range is : 1-5
* for part b the range is : 6-13
* for part c the range is : 14-17
* for part d the range is : 18-25

Each click of the button will change the numbers.

The buttons are independent of each other, that mean that it is possible to run in a different order without affecting the results.

If the result of part b or d return the same number twice the user can click again for different results.

Thanks to using only buttons, there is no risk of improper input.
